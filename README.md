# Countdown-Timer
Exploring front end and basic javascript

While exploring my choices for starting out on my first project, I started to look for what motivated me the most. I found that the fear of not acheiving my goals in college and losing motivation was my biggest motivator for pushing myself. Which led me to prototype a countdown timer for my graduation date. This project allowed me to explore the basics of front end web design and allowed me to use my html and css knowledge to cerate a countdown with an aesthetic background that I use as my default page, reminding myself everyday of what I'm wokring towards.
